- 👋 Hi, I’m @flotasser
- 👀 I’m interested in Blender, Krita, all things digital art. Not only limited to Open Source but loving the idea of it more than proprietary software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my very first few baby steps in Windows Batch File/Python "coding". (Automating of boring things)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things Open Source where I can help from the perspective of a creative person.
- 📫 How to reach me: twitter.com/flotasser, artstation.com/flotasser, facebook.com/flotasser
